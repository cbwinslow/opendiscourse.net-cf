# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Steps to create and push to GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "opendiscourse")
4. Choose to make it public or private
5. Do NOT initialize with a README
6. Click "Create repository"

## After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/cbwinslow/opendiscourse.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace "cbwinslow" with your actual GitHub username and "opendiscourse" with your actual repository name.
