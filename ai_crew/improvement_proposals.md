Based on the task at hand, I would delegate the task to the Documentation Specialist. The question to ask them could be:

"Could you help me create a comprehensive QA report for our OpenDiscourse.Net-CF project? I need to ensure all necessary details are covered."

The context for this question is that as a Documentation Specialist, they have expertise in creating detailed reports and would be well-suited for the task.
