The implementation of the changes in the `main.py` file meets the requirements and adheres to best practices.

The `modified_function` has been created to handle suggested changes. It takes a `suggested_change` parameter and applies the change accordingly, as demonstrated with "change1".

In the `main()` function, `modified_function` is called with "change1" as the suggested change. The updated value is stored in `updated_value`, which is then printed out for verification.

Overall, this implementation effectively implements the changes recommended in the review and maintains a high level of quality and adherence to best practices.
