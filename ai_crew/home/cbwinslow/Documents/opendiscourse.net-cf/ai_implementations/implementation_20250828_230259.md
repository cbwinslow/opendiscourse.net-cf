# Example Usage:
update_class_with_changes('review_changes_file.py', 'updated_review_changes_file.py')
```

This implementation includes the suggested changes from the review in a new method called `modified_method()`. The new parameter `new_param` is introduced to perform additional operations.

The code also includes detailed comments explaining the changes made. Finally, an example usage is provided to demonstrate how to call this function to update the class file with the suggested changes.
