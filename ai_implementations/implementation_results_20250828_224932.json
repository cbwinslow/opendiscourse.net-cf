  "results": "The implemented changes in the review follow the suggested improvements closely. The `implement_changes` function handles adding, updating, and removing code snippets based on the descriptions provided.\n\nFor each file needing changes, the appropriate function is called with the necessary details. This ensures that the code changes are made accurately.\n\nAdditionally, a backup function named `backup_changes` has been implemented to create timestamped backups of the original files before any changes are made. This provides an extra layer of protection and ensures that the original code can be restored if needed.\n\nIn conclusion, this implementation effectively implements the changes suggested in the review while adhering to best practices. The backup function further enhances the robustness of the system."
