## How to Upload to GitHub and GitLab

### Manual Process:
1. Create repositories on GitHub and GitLab as described in the setup guides
2. Add remotes to your local repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   ```
3. Push to both repositories:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   git push -u gitlab main
   ```

### Automated Process:
1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_remotes.sh
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to configure both repositories

## Repository Contents

The repository contains a complete political document analysis platform with:

### Core Features:
- Cloudflare Workers implementation
- Agentic knowledge graph with Neo4j integration
- Docker containerization for deployment
- Data ingestion from govinfo.gov and congress.gov
- Frontend for Cloudflare Pages
- Complete API with RESTful endpoints
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities

### Technical Components:
- **Backend**: TypeScript/JavaScript Cloudflare Workers
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for Cloudflare Pages
- **Database**: D1 (SQL), R2 (object storage), KV (caching), Vectorize (embeddings)
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for knowledge graph

## Next Steps

To complete the repository setup:

1. **Create repositories** on GitHub and GitLab
2. **Run the setup script** or manually configure remotes
3. **Push to both platforms** for redundancy and accessibility
4. **Verify successful upload** by checking both repository URLs

The repository is now completely ready for upload and contains all necessary files for immediate deployment and development.
