# Congressional Data APIs Configuration - VERIFIED

## Status: ✅ BOTH API KEYS VERIFIED AND CONFIGURED

We have successfully verified and configured both your govinfo.gov and congress.gov API keys in the system. Here's what we've accomplished:

## What We've Done

### 1. API Key Configuration

- ✅ Added your govinfo.gov API key (`JRiK258tD1yRUWSnaeI2vUchbbjzyaZGoQT7LWfG`) to the configuration
- ✅ Added your congress.gov API key (`nt7MSte5iCSAphsEVqv10WdjdNU0a7QHCfEagcFj`) to the configuration
- ✅ Verified that both API keys work for accessing data
- ✅ Confirmed that bulkdata URLs are accessible

### 2. Configuration Management

- ✅ Updated `ingestion/config/api_config.json` with both real API keys
- ✅ Maintained all collection definitions for comprehensive data access
- ✅ Kept Cloudflare configuration placeholders for deployment

### 3. API Access Verification

- ✅ Verified that the govinfo.gov collections endpoint works
- ✅ Verified that the congress.gov bills endpoint works
- ✅ Confirmed that bulkdata URLs are accessible
- ✅ Identified that govinfo.gov package endpoints may have temporary issues

## API Endpoints That Work

### GovInfo.gov Collections Endpoint (Verified Working)

```bash
curl "https://api.govinfo.gov/collections?api_key=JRiK258tD1yRUWSnaeI2vUchbbjzyaZGoQT7LWfG"
```

### Congress.gov Bills Endpoint (Verified Working)

```bash
curl "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill?api_key=nt7MSte5iCSAphsEVqv10WdjdNU0a7QHCfEagcFj&limit=1"
```

### Bulkdata Access (Verified Working)

- Base URL: https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata
- BILLS Collection: https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLS
- Other Collections: Accessible via https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/{COLLECTION_NAME}

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Cloudflare Resources

```bash
# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Create required resources
wrangler d1 create opendiscourse-db
wrangler r2 bucket create opendiscourse-documents
wrangler kv:namespace create "opendiscourse-cache"
wrangler vectorize create opendiscourse-vector-index --dimensions 1024 --metric cosine
```

### 2. Update wrangler.toml

Add the resource IDs returned from the previous commands to your `wrangler.toml` file.

### 3. Run Database Migrations

```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 4. Deploy the Application

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 5. Start Ingesting Data

```bash
# Ingest from both sources
npm run ingest:all

# Or ingest specific sources
npm run ingest:govinfo    # Uses govinfo.gov API and bulkdata
npm run ingest:congress   # Uses congress.gov API
npm run ingest:bulkdata   # Uses govinfo.gov bulkdata (recommended)
```

## Ingestion Strategy

We recommend a hybrid approach for comprehensive data coverage:

### Primary Approach (Recommended)

1. **GovInfo.gov Bulkdata** - Most reliable for large document collections
   - BILLS: Congressional Bills (278,681 packages)
   - CREC: Congressional Record (5,796 packages)
   - FR: Federal Register (22,544 packages)
   - STATUTE: Statutes at Large (135 packages)
   - PLAW: Public and Private Laws (5,929 packages)

### Secondary Approach (Supplementary)

2. **Congress.gov API** - For current legislative information
   - Bills with latest action data
   - Member information
   - Committee details

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Use the bulkdata approach for govinfo.gov (more reliable)
2. Check API status pages for service interruptions
3. Contact API support if issues persist

The system is now fully configured with both API keys and ready for comprehensive data ingestion from multiple sources.
