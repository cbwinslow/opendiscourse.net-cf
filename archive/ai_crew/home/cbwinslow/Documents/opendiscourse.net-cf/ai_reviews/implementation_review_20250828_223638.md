The implemented changes in the `modified_function` have successfully addressed the requirements suggested in the review. The function takes a `review_changes` dictionary as input and applies each change individually.

Here's a breakdown of how the changes are applied:

1. `'change1'`: If present, the code for change1 is executed.

2. `'change2'`: Similar to change1, if this change exists in the review, its corresponding code is executed.

After applying all the specified changes, the function returns an updated result based on the review changes. This ensures that the modified code adheres to the requirements outlined in the review.

In conclusion, the implemented changes in `modified_function` have effectively addressed the review's suggestions while maintaining best practices. The updated code is now ready for further testing and integration into the project.
