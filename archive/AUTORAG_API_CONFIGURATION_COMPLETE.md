# AutoRAG API Configuration - COMPLETE

## Status: ✅ CONFIGURATION FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTED

We have successfully implemented the framework for configuring the AutoRAG system to connect to govinfo.gov and congress.gov APIs. Here's what was accomplished:

## What We've Done

### 1. API Integration Framework
- Created configuration files that support govinfo.gov and congress.gov APIs
- Implemented ingestion modules that can connect to these APIs
- Built bulkdata processing capabilities for govinfo.gov/bulkdata

### 2. Configuration Management
- Created `api_config.json.example` with proper structure
- Updated the main configuration file with placeholder values
- Added detailed documentation in `autorag/API_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`

### 3. API-Specific Components
- Enhanced `GovInfoIngestion` class to work with govinfo.gov API
- Created `GovInfoBulkDataProcessor` for bulkdata processing
- Configured API endpoints and authentication mechanisms

## How to Configure for Real API Usage

### Step 1: Obtain API Keys
1. **govinfo.gov**: Visit https://api.govinfo.gov/signup/
2. **congress.gov**: Visit https://congress.gov/api/Documentation

### Step 2: Configure the System
```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp ingestion/config/api_config.json.example ingestion/config/api_config.json

# Edit with your real API keys
nano ingestion/config/api_config.json
```

### Step 3: Test Connectivity
```bash
# Test govinfo API
curl "https://api.govinfo.gov/collections/BILLS?offset=0&pageSize=1&api_key=YOUR_GOVINFO_API_KEY"

# Test congress API
curl "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill?api_key=YOUR_CONGRESS_API_KEY&limit=1"
```

### Step 4: Run Ingestion
```bash
# Ingest from govinfo.gov
npm run ingest:govinfo

# Ingest from congress.gov
npm run ingest:congress

# Ingest bulkdata from govinfo.gov
npm run ingest:bulkdata

# Ingest everything
npm run ingest:all
```

## API Endpoints Configured

### govinfo.gov API
- Base URL: https://api.govinfo.gov
- Collections endpoint: /collections/{collection}
- Packages endpoint: /packages/{packageId}/summary
- Granules endpoint: /packages/{packageId}/granules
- Bulkdata URL: https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata

### congress.gov API
- Base URL: https://api.congress.gov/v3
- Bills endpoint: /bill
- Members endpoint: /member
- Committees endpoint: /committee

## Verification

The configuration framework has been verified:
- ✅ All required files are present
- ✅ Configuration structure is correct
- ✅ API endpoints are properly defined
- ✅ Authentication mechanisms are in place
- ✅ Documentation is complete

## Next Steps

To actually connect to the real APIs:

1. Obtain your API keys from govinfo.gov and congress.gov
2. Update `ingestion/config/api_config.json` with your real keys
3. Test connectivity with curl commands
4. Run ingestion scripts to start processing real data

The system is now fully configured to draw from the API endpoints at govinfo.gov/bulkdata and congress.gov. All that's needed are your actual API credentials.
