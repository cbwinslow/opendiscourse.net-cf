## Qwen Added Memories

- I must update the tasks.md file whenever progress is made on the OpenDiscourse project and never delete any items from the list, only check them off when completed.
- I have successfully built an agentic knowledge graph system for political document analysis with Neo4j integration, entity relationship extraction, political bias detection, fact-checking, hate speech detection, and politician profiling. I have updated the tasks.md file to reflect the progress made on these components.
